Sam: Mom, Dad . . . Can I get a pet? 
Mom: Well, Sam . . .
Dad: I don't know.
Sam: Please? I'm six now. I'm old enough! 
Mom and Dad: Okay. 
Sam: Yeah!
Dad: But remember, Sam—this will be your pet. 
You must take care of it.
Sam: I will!
Tia, Max! My parents said yes. I can get a pet!
Tia and Max: Wow! 
Max: What kind of pet?
Sam: I can't decide.
Tia: A goldfish?
Sam: They swim too much, Tia.
Max: A cat?
Sam: They sleep too much, Max.
Grandma Ruby: How about a hamster, Sam?
Sam: No, Grandma Ruby. 
They stay inside too much.
Lilly: A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba? 
Sam: You're just a baby, Lilly. 
You don't know anything about pets.
I want a pet that can run and play outside.
Dad: Come on, Sam. 
We're going to the boardwalk.
Sam: Okay.
Mom: Let's get some hot chocolate.
Dad: Three, please.
Sam: A dog! Mom . . . Dad . . .
A dog is the perfect pet for me!

Sam and Lucky 2: Sam Meets Lucky

Sam: When can I get my dog?
Mom: It’s going to take time, Sam.
Sam: Tomorrow? Please?
Mom: We will go to the animal shelter soon. 
I promise. Dad wants to come too.
Sam: A shelter is a place for animals with no homes.
Lilly: Woof! Woof!
Sam: I know, Lilly. It’s so hard to wait.
Dad: What about this one, Sam?
Sam:  I’m not sure . . . I like that one!
Mom: He’s too big for us, Sam.
Sam: Umm . . . George, what’s that dog’s name?
George: Lucky.
Mom: He seems sad.
George: He misses his family.
They were moving and couldn't take him along.
Look at that!
Sam: Good boy . . . nice boy . . .
Lilly: Woof! Woof!
George: I've never seen Lucky so happy.
He likes you, Sam!

Sam: This is my room, Lucky! 
That's your new bed.
Dad: I think he likes it here!
Lucky: Ruff! Ruff!
Sam: He knows what dog treats are!
Dad: Taking care of a pet is a lot of work, Sam.
You must feed Lucky two times a day.
Mom: And walk him three times a day.
Here's his collar and leash.
Dad: Remember to keep the gates locked.
We don't want Lucky to run away.
Sam: I will!
Tia: Hi, Sam! Is that your new dog?
Sam: Yes! This is Lucky.  
And Lucky, these are my friends, Max and Tia!

Now can I go outside?
Mom: Put on warm clothes, Sam. It's cold!
Sam: Hi, Grandpa Bill. We have a snow day!
Grandpa Bill: I'm sorry, Sam. 
You must be very sad about missing school.
Sam: No way! Look, Grandpa. 
Lucky loves the snow.
Bye. We're going to Max's house.
Tia: Let's make a snowman.
Max: First we need the bottom.
Sam: Now the middle.
Tia: Next the head.
Max: These are his arms.
Tia: Here are his eyes and mouth.
Sam: He can have my scarf.
It's okay, Lucky! It's just a snowman.
Max: He still needs a nose.
Tia: Hmm . . . What can we use?
Sam: Lucky!
Tia: It's a ball.
Sam: No. It's a—nose!

Sam and Lucky 5: The Sleepover

Sam: Lucky loved playing in the snow!
Mrs. Brown: I'm sorry Lucky couldn't come in, Sam. 
Ginger does not like dogs.

Max: Mom, can Sam . . .? Sam! Want to sleep over?
Sam: Yes.
Mrs. Brown: Check with your mom first, Sam.
Sam: Okay!
Mom: You will need pajamas and a pillow.
Sam: It's just one night, Lucky. 
I'll be back soon.
Mom: Are you sure you want to go, Sam? 
It's your first sleepover and—
Sam: I'm sure! It will be fun!
Great Super Chicken movie!
Max: I know! POW!
Sam: BAM!
Max: But Super Chicken wouldn't fight with soft pillows!
Sam: Nope. He'd use his super powers!
Mrs. Brown: Lights out, boys! 
Good night, Sam. Sleep tight.
Max: We should have a sleepover every night, right, Sam?
Sam: Right . . .

Sam and Lucky 6: The Next Day

My dog, Lucky, is really smart. 
He can sit and speak and shake hands.
I mean, paws!
Ginger: Purr . . . purr . . .
Sam: And he loves to play fetch . . . 
I throw a ball, and he . . .
Sam: Hi, Mom! Hi, Lilly! I'm home!
Mom: Hi, Sam! Did you have a good time?
Lilly: Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!
Sam: Yes. We played superheroes and watched a movie.
Mom: Did you get homesick?
Sam: No! Well . . . maybe a little. But we had fun!
Mom: I'm glad, honey. Welcome home.
Sam: Where's Lucky? I—
Lucky! That's enough, silly boy. 
Want to play in the snow?
Lucky: Woof! Woof!

Sam: I have to make Valentine's Day cards.
My class is having a party tomorrow.
Lucky! No!

Mom: Everyone will understand. 
Come on, honey. It’s time to go.
Sam: Thank you, Lulu.
Lulu: Where are your Valentines?
Sam: It’s a long story.
Freddie: Here you go.
Sam: Sorry, Freddie. I don’t have any cards. 
My dog ate them.
Freddie: That’s okay, Sam.
Mrs. Swan: You look sad, Sam.

Tia: My family went to Mexico last month. 
We had fun. Yes, Connor?

He's very old—and very funny!

We enjoyed hearing about your trip! 
One more person is sharing today. 
He is bringing—

Sam: Yes. He knows how to sit and speak. Sit, Lucky!
Lucky: Woof! Woof!
Sam: No, Lucky. SIT!    
Patrick: Hey! That's my snack!
Sam: Lucky! Bad dog! Sorry, Patrick!
I told everyone that Lucky is a good dog. 
But he's being bad!
Max: It's okay, Sam. Lucky is just excited today.
Sam: It's terrible.
Mrs. Swan: Sam's dad is waiting outside. 
Lucky has to go soon. 
We have time for one more question.

Have you seen Lucky?
Erik: Who’s Lucky?

Maybe I'll be a . . . train conductor . . . 
or a baseball player . . . or . . . a dog trainer!

Sam and Lucky 14: Dinosaurs!

Sam: Look! An Allosaurus!
Dad: Wow . . . That thing must have been fierce.
Sam: It was a meat eater with sharp teeth!

Sam: Don't worry, Lilly.
They were big, but they only ate plants.

I'm not very fast anymore.
Mr. Doyle: Hi, Bill! Hi, Sam!
