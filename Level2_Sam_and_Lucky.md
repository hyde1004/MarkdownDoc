Mom and Dad: Okay. 
Sam: Yeah!
Dad: But remember, Sam—this will be your pet. 
You must take care of it.
Sam: I will!
Tia, Max! My parents said yes. I can get a pet!
Tia and Max: Wow!

Max: A cat?
Sam: They sleep too much, Max.
Grandma Ruby: How about a hamster, Sam?
Sam: No, Grandma Ruby. 
They stay inside too much.
Lilly: A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba?

You don't know anything about pets.
I want a pet that can run and play outside.
Dad: Come on, Sam. 
We're going to the boardwalk.
Sam: Okay.
Mom: Let's get some hot chocolate.
Dad: Three, please.
Sam: A dog! Mom . . . Dad . . .
A dog is the perfect pet for me!

Lilly: Woof! Woof!
Sam: I know, Lilly. It’s so hard to wait.
Dad: What about this one, Sam?

Mom: He’s too big for us, Sam.
Sam: Umm . . . George, what’s that dog’s name?
George: Lucky.

They were moving and couldn't take him along.
Look at that!

Dad: Taking care of a pet is a lot of work, Sam.
You must feed Lucky two times a day.
Mom: And walk him three times a day.
Here's his collar and leash.
Dad: Remember to keep the gates locked.
We don't want Lucky to run away.
Sam: I will!
Tia: Hi, Sam! Is that your new dog?

It's your first sleepover and—
Sam: I'm sure! It will be fun!
Great Super Chicken movie!
Max: I know! POW!
Sam: BAM!
Max: But Super Chicken wouldn't fight with soft pillows!

I throw a ball, and he . . .
Sam: Hi, Mom! Hi, Lilly! I'm home!
Mom: Hi, Sam! Did you have a good time?
Lilly: Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!
